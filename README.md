# Development

To scrape data from the TVMaze API manually:
The scraper runs on startup to fetch data from the TVMaze API. However, you can manually trigger the scraper by calling the GetShowData method in the TVMazeService class.

using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
    var tvMazeService = services.GetRequiredService<TVMazeService>();
    await tvMazeService.GetShowData();
}

To add a new migration:
- If you need to modify the database schema, you can create a new migration:

dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
dotnet ef database update
